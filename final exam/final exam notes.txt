study notes:

remember to think of floats when printing, if hit by a number with a decimal the resulting number is a float

if end is set in print(), consider what happens if there's no \n

range(1,10) = 1-9

exponent = **
division = float
int division = int (//) - how many times into? ignore remainder
modulus = int (%) - what's the remainder

string[i] = one character
string[-i] = one character, start counting from end
string[i:j] = slice from i to j
string[:j] = slice from start to j
string[i:] = slice from i to end
string[:-j] = slice from start to -j from end

str * 3 = reat str 3 times
str + "3" = concatenate str and "3"
