# Pseduocode 1
# Cost per square inch of pizza
# Area = pi * radius to the 2nd power

## get input of radius of pizza (flt_pizza_radius)
## calculate(flt_pizza_area): area = pi * flt_pizza_radius ** 2
## print flt_pizza_area to screen

# Pseudocode 2
# Determine the most efficient breakdown of change
# Someone inputs $1.47 
# That would break down to 5 quarters, 2 dimes and 2 pennies

## get input of amount to distribute change (flt_amount_to_change)

## use integer division to find the following:

  ### find how many quarters are neeeded 
  ###### cnt_quarters = flt_amount_to_change // .25
  ### reduce the amount to change by the numbers of quarters used
  ###### flt_amount_to_change = flt_amount_to_change - cnt_quarters * .25

  ### find how many dimes are neeeded 
  ###### cnt_dimes = flt_amount_to_change // .10
  ### reduce the amount to change by the numbers of dimes used
  ###### flt_amount_to_change = flt_amount_to_change - cnt_dimes * .10

  ### find how many nickels are neeeded 
  ###### cnt_nickels = flt_amount_to_change // .05
  ### reduce the amount to change by the numbers of nickels used
  ###### flt_amount_to_change = flt_amount_to_change - cnt_nickels * .10

  ### find how many pennies are needed
  ###### cnt_pennies = flt_amount_to_change # already considered other coinage, only pennies remain

## print summary of coin counts to display count amounts

# Pseudocode 3
# A booksale
# Input is title, quantity & price, only one title is being purchased
# You need to print out subtotal, tax(you determine the rate) and total for the sale.

## input user for:
  ### book title (str_book_title)
  ### quantity (int_book_qty)
  ### price (flt_book_price)

## load tax rate (flt_tax_rate) # get tax rate from business

## calculate 
  ### sales subtotal (flt_subtotal): (int_book_qty * flt_book_price)
  ### tax amount (flt_sales_tax): (flt_subtotal * flt_tax_rate)
  ### transaction total: (flt_subtotal + (flt_sales_tax)

## print to user's screen
  ### sales subtotal
  ### tax amount
  ### transaction total
